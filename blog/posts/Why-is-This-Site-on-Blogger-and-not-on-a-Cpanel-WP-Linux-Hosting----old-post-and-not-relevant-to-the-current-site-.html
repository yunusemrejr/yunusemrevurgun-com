      <H2>Why is This Site on Blogger and not on a Cpanel/WP Linux Hosting? (*old post and not relevant to the current site)</H2>
 

      <div id="posts-container"><p>&nbsp;I think it can be a great idea to start off by explaining why me as a computer programmer ended up creating this blog/website on Blogger and not on a common hosting provider such as HostGator or NameCheap.</p>
<p>Well, as you may have guessed mostly the hosting costs and domain costs are the primary reason behind this decision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of now I already used lots of shared hosting packages with quite enough storage and bandwidth limits and it was amazing to take things out of the localhost to an actual server.</p>
<p>I still have an active hosting subscription on one of my favorite hosting providers that will not expire until the end of this year.</p>
<p>I already make websites with PHP &amp; JavaScript so why not make my personal blog the same way? Right?</p>
<p>I was not sure if I wanted to make a Blogger website as it is pretty much limited to front-end customization and plus even the front-end takes extra effort to customize compared to a regular Linux hosting with a Cpanel CMS.</p>
<p>I ended up choosing Blogger after all (as you can see).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already mentioned that the main motive for this decision is the hosting and domain costs that I need to keep track of and also of course because this blog aka. website is about writing articles on programming and explaining how to do certain things with certain technologies.</p>
<p>I could have used WordPress and I mean ".com", so that it has free hosting plans similar to Blogger. The truth is I don't really like WordPress. The plugins and everything are cool but I rather build my own ecosystem than to rely my projects on WP.</p>
<p>If I am building a website for commercial purposes, I don't think I can be happy being limited to WP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I did last year was to have a folder in one of my demo websites to WP and other folders had their custom scripts. So WP for "/blog" and everything else had its own PHP going on.</p>
<p>Anyways, I really get stressed out keeping track of hosting and domain renewals (yes there is a chance I am broke) and that is the main reason why I chose Blogger for this website.</p>
<p>If I am not going to run my scripts live on a server, why would I rent one just for my articles?</p>
<p>I already test every web project I make on my local machine and then upload them to my GitHub.</p>
<p>Why an extra stress?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last month I had this PHP project that I wanted to test out and I felt like I had to not only test it on my local machine but also on a shared hosting. I went for it and it was great as always but then I took it down and redirected the domain I bought for it to my GitHub. Because I realized I would need to pay every month for that single web project. It is already on my GitHub and anyone can run it on their own machine so why a hosting right? That's when I realized I really don't need to pay for shared hosting for every little thing I want people to take a look at.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am pretty happy with this Blogger / Blogspot blog here as of now actually. Yes, I cannot control the backend and yes the front-end is also very limiting, but it serves the purpose: a blog.</p>
<p>If you wonder what GUI customizations I made for this website, here are some of them (interestingly I didn't rely on JavaScript for the whole styling this time <i>*.style.display='block';</i>):</p>
<textarea style="height: 294px; width: 479px;">
<meta content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0' name='viewport'/>
<style>
.content-inner {
  border: 5px solid;
  border-radius: 10px;
  border-image: url() 30% round;
}

.content-cap-top, .cap-top {
  display: none;
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 884px) {

    transform-origin: 0 0;

.fauxcolumn-inner {

  border-radius: 23px;

.blog-posts {
  background-color: black;
  border: 1px solid black;
  border-radius: 10px;

.uncustomized-post-template {
  padding: 8px;
}
</style>
</textarea>
<div>
  <p>Yes, it is not much in the above snippet but most of the customizations are inline ("style='background-color:grey' />") so I would need to find and pick each one of them from the HTML source.</p>
  <p>You can always go and "view page source / inspect" though.</p>
  <p>I think I made my point and this has been a nice beginning on this blog. Let's see what's waiting for us. -/2022/06/09/Yunus Emre Vurgun</p>
