      <H2>My LinkedIn Post on Future of AI and ML</H2>
 

      <div id="posts-container"><p>For a while now, I've been thinking a lot about the possible future of hashtag#AI and scenarios of how hashtag#ML (Machine Learning) may change the near-future for all of us.</p>

<p>As a foundational way of how I naturally think, I began the process with &quot;fear of the unknown&quot;. As it generally happens, I tend to dig much deeper into the topic when this happens to me.</p>

<p>So, I started testing and running open-source ML algorithms to understand and learn more, meanwhile reading a lot of books on it.</p>

<p>Then, I created my own little AI programs using various programming languages and methods, where some of my apps were from scratch, such as numeric calculations involving one or multiple types of regression analysis for certain types of floating point data to estimate possible outcomes within a specific context.</p>

<p> For others, I implemented well-known libraries such as hashtag#TensorFlow for hashtag#JavaScript and hashtag#PyTorch via hashtag#Python and many others (mostly Python libraries) along the way. Then I started testing open versions of major LLMs that were easier to play around with, such as text-based LLM models like hashtag#GPT-2 via Google's hashtag#Colab cloud environment. It was indeed a lot of work, but was more like a fun and benefitial struggle for me in reality, which still continues in new ways.</p>

<p>I can't say it took away all the fear, but I can confidently say this journey made me realize many more nuances than what I expected to see initially.</p>

<p>As I am writing this, I see a &quot;Rewrite with AI&quot; button on my screen, which is a new hashtag#LinkedIn feature.</p>

<p>If I click on that, which I won't for this post, as it sounds a bit funny to write about AI with the help of an AI tool, at least for me, for a semi personal blog-like article as this one.<br>
But, if I click on that, I know from previous tests, that it will rewrite this content in a better grammer and punctuation, let alone other minor errors.</p>

<p>I can take it a step further and feed this post into hashtag#NLP hashtag#LLM models and generate lengthier, focused, professional outputs compared to this, my original text.</p>

<p>I could even create images for this post with say, hashtag#Gemini by hashtag#Google or hashtag#GPT4 by hashtag#OpenAI or other major tools, instead of slightly editing a stock image I found from hashtag#Wikipedia, which is the image attached to this post. I just increased some parameters, rotated it, and here it is.</p>

<p>I am not that concerned about AI taking over computer science itself, because I figured out it is a deep paradox and a useless argument, and in some aspects childish, as we know that transforming a field is not equal to &quot;taking over&quot; or &quot;destroying&quot; and as a product of pure mathematics and computer hardware advancements in the modern era,<br>
we know for a fact that it is a result of hashtag#CS, not a mysterious enemy of it, not even a little bit. Is a strawberry in the field an absurd entity for a farmer who planted it? No. Can strawberry lure snakes into the farm? Yes. Will the snakes destroy everything in the farm? No. Can a tomato replace a farmer's hat? No. <br>
Therefore, my main fear is not my field, but everything else. What we stand for, our purpose and even what makes us unique. If we reach a point of extreme artificial intelligence that can write novels in a skill 100% above all known human authors (may not be obgevtively determined given the complexity), can write 1000 lines of advanced logical expressions in any given computer technology/code with zero error, can discover better methodologies in other scientific fields better than any human, if we reach these levels, <br> what will make us unique? The second question on my mind is, of course, can it? People tend to believe in a &quot;yes! Look how amazing the given neural networks are!&quot; Formatted fashion, but let's just stop and think. We created computers that could rapidly calculate millions of entities at a given time, and no human ever could do any of it, at all.  <br> <br>But, we don't say an x86 CPU is greater than homo sapiens. Why? Because we literally made it ourselves to <br> solve a problem we had. Same for every single thing we have ever created and ever will. If there may be an evil robot with super AI capabilities that could destroy humanity, it is not the robot who is the source of power, but it is the people behind it vs. people facing it.</p></div>
