Yes, Sora and Bard are amazing, and tens of billions of parameters are also very impressive.
<br><br>
This will evolve, but there isn’t a guarantee that the same speed will continue in the development of these projects if the metric is the ‘originality’, or ‘new ways’ of producing gen-AI outcomes/results.
<br><br>
Many people try to relate to new AI models as if they are interacting with a human clone, try to find traces of advanced logic, human feelings, and such,
which is currently very much impossible.
<br><br>
Choose your favorite large language model, use an excessive amount of processing power, and try to do a very long logical reasoning experiment.
You will realize patterns and certain weighs in the model, that will make you go “ohh so that’s why it keeps doing this correct/wrong”.
<br><br>
Therefore, things will improve much more, but most probably never in my lifetime, we will see evil robots equipped with supercomputers try to control the milky way.<br>
